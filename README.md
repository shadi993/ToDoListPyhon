# To Do List in Python

my first to do list program using python

problems:
* (fixed)~~the list get duplicated or/and deleted sometimes after reopening the program~~
* (fixed)~~when the app start, the first raw is always empty and when you make a new list, it will put it on the second line~~
* (fixed)~~keep adding new lines after you reopen the program~~

plans:
* maybe i could change it from console/Terminal app to window/Tk application
